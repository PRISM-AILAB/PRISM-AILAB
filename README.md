I am an Assistant Professor at Hansung University specializing in **Big Data Analytics**, **Recommender Systems**, and **Natural Language Processing**.  
My research focuses on developing intelligent algorithms that enhance data-driven decision-making and personalized services. I am particularly interested in:

- Designing **deep learning-based recommender systems** that incorporate multimodal features such as text and images
- Building **LLM-powered NLP systems** for online review analysis, filtering, and classification
- Exploring **explainable AI techniques** for interpretable and trustworthy model predictions

I actively pursue interdisciplinary research that bridges machine learning, user behavior analysis, and real-world applications such as e-commerce and digital platforms.
